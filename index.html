                    Hi, I am Yuexuan Li! You can also call me Kiara.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a first-year master’s student at Columbia University studying Mechanical Engineering,
                    I have honed my skills in applying more AI technology to robotics through control and dynamics.
                    Currently, I am actively seeking an internship in robotics or machine learning in the US.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hardware abilities gained from years of several projects, which involve the slam robot and soft-robot control,
                    and I acquired practical software engineering that enabled me to combine what I learned and what I like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before starting my graduate studies, I spent my undergraduate years at Dalian University of Technology,
                    where I studied Engineering Mechanics in the beautiful seaside city of Dalian, China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to spend time with friends and explore new places, whether it be traveling or just checking out local stores.
                    If you share any of my interests, don't hesitate to reach out. I am always looking for new friends and adventures!

                    By doing this project, multiple evolutionary algorithms (Genetic algorithms, Genetic programming), and evolutionary strategies (Co-evolution, Stable states) were built to evolve robots with variable morphology and evolved the fastest robot.

                  Robot Design Project
                </a>
                <p>
                    During this project, I applied Solidworks and Python to design and create a legged robot, covering conceptual design, detailed design, simulation and modeling, digital manufacturing, electronics, and sensor design. I used a 3D printer to print the body of my robot and optimized the gait in simulation and reality by Python.

                </a>
                <p>
                  The project's hyperspectral imager, a camera that can fit into a small satellite, can take continuous images of the same area to track ships in the area and observe their traffic, collect research on illegal fishing or drug traffic, and also has practical implications for identifying ships, assisting in tracking targets, and providing other supporting information to avoid collisions.

                  I was responsible for designing the algorithm in MATLAB, which is used to identify the ships in the image and calculate the size, heading, and speed of the ship. I used real data to test the algorithm and the test file generated in real data format.

                  Shake-down analysis of bi-modulus structures
                </a>
                <p>
                  In this paper, the relationship between stress and displacement of a three-bar structure with a bi-modulus of elasticity in tension and compression is investigated by using the elastic-plasticity theory, and an expression for the ultimate external load is derived for a three-bar structure with a bi-modulus of elasticity in tension and compression to maintain stability. Further calculations are carried out to analyze the different tensile yield stresses and compressive yield stresses. The calculation results show that the different modulus of elasticity in tension and compression and the asymmetric yield stress in tension and compression affect the ultimate external load of the structure, which is a safety issue of concern for engineering structures.

                  We mainly used tree machine learning models, Linear regression/Non-linear regression, Logistic regression, and Decision to predict which factor impacts an apartment rental and find the high performance-to-price ratio apartment.
