                    Hi, I am Yuexuan Li! You can also call me Kiara.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Columbia University, 
                    and I earned my Bachelor's degree in Engineering Mechanics from Dalian University of Technology last year. 
                    My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in science and mechanics. 
                    Furthermore, my practical experience in design and manufacturing has been cultivated through various projects during my graduate studies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time, I love to spend time with friends and explore new places, whether it be traveling or just checking out local stores.
                    If you share any of my interests, don't hesitate to reach out. I am always looking for new friends and adventures!

                </a>
                <p>
                  In this project, I explored the Visual Affordance method for visual robotic pack-and-place tasks. 
                    I implemented and trained a Visual Affordance model with manually labeled data and used rotated heightmaps, 
                    domain randomization, and self-supervision to improve the model's performance. We aimed to improve the 
                    model's grasp success rate on unseen novel objects.

                    During this project, I applied Solidworks and Python to design and create a legged robot, covering conceptual design, detailed design, simulation and modeling, digital manufacturing, electronics, and sensor design. I used a 3D printer to print the body of my robot and optimized the gait in simulation and reality by Python.

                <p>
                  This project utilized VPython to create a physical simulator and implemented multiple evolutionary algorithms (Genetic algorithms, Genetic programming）and evolutionary strategies (Co-evolution, Stable states) in Python to evolve robots with variable morphology and faster speeds.  I also created a robot zoo to compare different robots.

                <p>
                  Smart Signs is an exciting project that addresses a common frustration for commuters - the uncertainty of public transportation. Our team has developed a solution that replaces static subway signs with dynamic Smart Screens that can be remotely updated in real-time to reflect track maintenance and delays.

                <p>
                  Our team's project is an excellent example of the power of design thinking and collaboration. We identified an emerging human need and utilized new technology to create a product that addresses that need. We are proud to have made a solution that has the potential to improve the daily commute for countless individuals.

                  In our project, we leveraged SIMULINK to implement simulations, encompassing trajectory planning and other related aspects. Additionally, we performed thorough analyses across various domains, including workspace analysis, path planning analysis, dynamic analysis, force analysis, joint trajectory analysis, and more. By synergizing our expertise in DH-table calculation, singularity analysis, and workspace analysis with the utilization of SIMULINK for simulations, we successfully optimized the robot arm's trajectory. This optimization enhanced operational capabilities, ensuring the robot arm's movements were efficient, accurate, and confined within its designated workspace.

                <p>
                  The project's hyperspectral imager, a camera that can fit into a small satellite, can take continuous images of the same area to track ships in the area and observe their traffic, collect research on illegal fishing or drug traffic, and also has practical implications for identifying ships, assisting in tracking targets, and providing other supporting information to avoid collisions.

                  I was responsible for designing the algorithm in MATLAB, which is used to identify the ships in the image and calculate the size, heading, and speed of the ship. I used real data to test the algorithm and the test file generated in real data format.

                  Shake-down analysis of bi-modulus structures
                </a>
                <p>
                  In this paper, the relationship between stress and displacement of a three-bar structure with a bi-modulus of elasticity in tension and compression is investigated by using the elastic-plasticity theory, and an expression for the ultimate external load is derived for a three-bar structure with a bi-modulus of elasticity in tension and compression to maintain stability. Further calculations are carried out to analyze the different tensile yield stresses and compressive yield stresses. The calculation results show that the different modulus of elasticity in tension and compression and the asymmetric yield stress in tension and compression affect the ultimate external load of the structure, which is a safety issue of concern for engineering structures.
